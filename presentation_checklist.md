## ðŸš¨ Common Questions & Answers

### **Q: How does the AI understand the data?**
**A**: The system uses a two-step process:
1. **ProfilingService** analyzes data structure, types, and quality
2. **AgentService** uses LLM prompts to generate human-readable descriptions and relationships

### **Q: How safe is the code execution?**
**A**: Multiple safety layers:
- Isolated Jupyter kernels per session
- Timeout protection and resource limits
- Input validation and sanitization
- Automatic session cleanup

### **Q: Can it handle different types of data?**
**A**: Yes, the system includes:
- Intelligent type inference (numeric, datetime, categorical)
- Automatic type conversion suggestions
- Support for various data formats and structures

### **Q: How does the multi-agent system work?**
**A**: LangGraph orchestrates 5 specialized agents:
1. **Planner**: Breaks down queries into steps
2. **Code Generator**: Creates Python code
3. **Executor**: Runs code safely
4. **Error Analyzer**: Fixes issues
5. **Chart Generator**: Creates visualizations

### **Q: What makes this different from other tools?**
**A**: Unique combination of:
- Real-time agent thought streaming
- Safe code execution with state persistence
- Intelligent relationship inference
- Interactive natural language interface
